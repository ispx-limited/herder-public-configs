// Herder operator-script SDK reference.
//
// This file is the contract every .ts script in herder-public-configs and
// operator forks types against. Maintained alongside the runtime evaluator;
// drift is caught by the upload-time type-check. A copy ships in
// herder-public-configs as types/sdk.d.ts and must stay byte-identical.
//
// One unified surface for both subsystems:
//   - Telemetry enrichment scripts (`emit`, `topology.*`, `enrichment`,
//     `batch`, `ctx`).
//   - Provisioning scripts (`device.{get,set,fetch,...}`, `provision.*`).
//
// Optional fields (`get?`, `addTag?`, etc.) split which globals each
// subsystem exposes at runtime — calling `device.get(...)` from an
// enrichment script type-checks (it's optional) but throws at runtime.
// Per-source-type stricter declarations are a follow-up if the unified
// surface confuses operators.
